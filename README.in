This program allows the body and/or envelope of a message to be filtered
through a series of filters before being passed to the real qmail-queue
program, and injected into the qmail queue.

Requirements:

- bglibs is required for system dependancies.

- This program is designed to take advantage of my QMAILQUEUE patch,
  which causes programs that would execute qmail-queue (such as
  qmail-smtpd etc.) to execute an alternative program.

How to install:

- Check the definitions at the top of qmail-qfilter.c, especially the
  value of TMPDIR.  If you trust mkstemp(3), this can be a world-writable
  /tmp.  If you don't, this should be set to a temporary directory that
  only the executor of qmail-qfilter has write access to.
- Check the conf-* files for appropriate values for your compiler and
  linker, and installation paths.
- Run "make"
- As root, run "make install"

How to use, with the QMAILQUEUE patch applied to qmail:

- Create a script containing an invocation of qmail-qfilter.  For
  example, a script that uses qmail-inject as a front end to qmail-queue
  would contain:
	#!/bin/sh
	exec /path/to/qmail-qfilter /var/qmail/bin/qmail-inject -n
- Set the environment variable QMAILQUEUE to the location of this
  script.  For example, in a SMTP rules files, put:
	A.B.C.D:allow,RELAYCLIENT="",QMAILQUEUE="/usr/local/bin/qmail-qftest"
  and rebuild the SMTP CDB file.
- You're all set!  In our example, all messages sent from the IP A.B.C.D
  will have their content filtered through qmail-inject, which will add
  missing "From:", "Date:", and "Message-Id:" headers.

How to use, without the QMAILQUEUE patch:
- Change the definition of QMAIL_QUEUE in qmail-qfilter.c to a different
  value, either by editing the source file or by modifying the DEFINES
  line in the Makefile to read:
	-DQMAIL_QUEUE=\"/var/qmail/bin/qmail-queue-old\"
- Compile qmail-qfilter.
- Rename qmail-queue to the new filename specified above.
- Create a script to replace qmail-queue that contains an invocation of
  qmail-qfilter, as described in the previous example.
- You're all set!  All mail entering the queue will be filtered by your
  filter.

Notes on writing a filter program:
- If you want to block an email, exit from the filter with code 31.
  This will cause qmail-qfilter to exit with the same error code, and
  qmail-smtpd (for example) to send an error code to the client.
- If you want to silently drop an email, exit with code 99.
- The filter script that executes qmail-queue MUST NOT be setuid, and
  MUST BE readable.  Only the real qmail-queue binary needs to be
  setuid.

See the scripts in the "samples" directory for example scripts.
